# UKG-Industry-Project

Employee Rewards Dashboard and Mood Management System
This hackathon project is a dashboard developed for UKG that integrates a scoring system for employees, enabling them to earn rewards based on their status within the organization. 
Additionally, the dashboard includes a mood section, where employees can select emojis to express their feelings. 
A chat bot, powered by OpenAI's API, provides support and assistance to employees, helping them manage their emotions and improve their well-being. 
Managers are also provided with a mood board report, enabling them to track the moods of their employees effectively.

Features
Scoring System: The dashboard includes a scoring system that assigns points & tiers to employees based on their performance, engagement around the office, and other relevant metrics. These points contribute to the employee's status within the organization and increase their chances of winning rewards.

Rewards and Recognition: Employees can view their current status and the rewards associated with each level. As they accumulate more points, their status increases, and they become eligible for better rewards and recognition within the company.

Mood Selection: The mood section of the dashboard allows employees to express their emotions by selecting emojis that represent their current state of mind. This feature helps employees communicate their feelings effectively.

Chat Bot Integration: Clicking on an emoji triggers the appearance of a chat bot, which is powered by OpenAI's API. The chat bot engages in conversation with employees, offering support, advice, and resources to help them manage their emotions and improve their well-being.

Manager's Mood Board Report: Managers have access to a mood board report that provides an overview of their team members' moods. This report enables managers to monitor the emotional well-being of their employees and take appropriate actions if necessary.

Technologies Used:
Front-end: Built with React, Sass, & JavaScript
Back-end: Node.js
OpenAI API: Used for powering the chat bot and natural language processing capabilities.


Future Enhancements:
Integration with employee performance data to provide personalized insights and recommendations.
Real-time notifications for managers based on significant changes in employee moods.
Improved natural language processing capabilities for the chat bot to enhance the quality of support provided.
